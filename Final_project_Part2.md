> Quote from a cultural expert on the importance of names in preserving heritage


#### Wireframe 5: Cultural Influences
##### TTitle: "Cultural Trends Shaping NYC Baby Names"
- Text: "Explore how cultural shifts and significant events have influenced baby naming trends in New York City. From popular TV shows to societal changes, see how these factors have left their mark on the city's naming landscape."
- Timeline: Create a timeline that highlights notable cultural events from 2011 to 2014, such as popular movies, TV shows, or social movements, and correlate these with spikes in name popularity. For example, if a character from a hit TV show had a unique name that became popular, highlight this connection.
- Case Study: Conduct a deep dive into a specific name that saw a significant rise in popularity due to a cultural phenomenon. Provide data visualizations showing the name's trend over time and discuss potential reasons for its rise.
- Interactive Element: Instead of "Name Your Era," consider an interactive timeline where users can hover over different years to see which names were influenced by specific cultural events. ( implementation is tentative)
- Quiz: Which 2012 blockbuster movie character's name became a top 10 baby name?
- Future Forecast: Use data analysis to predict future naming trends based on current cultural influences. This could involve analyzing current popular culture and projecting potential impacts on baby names. (I am not able to create a forecoast for the data as the time series is too short to do so in tableau hence exploring different alternatives)
