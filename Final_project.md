# Project: Naming Trends in New York City: A Cultural Tapestry
## Overview
New York City is a melting pot of cultures, and this diversity is reflected in the names parents choose for their children. This project aims to explore the patterns and trends in baby naming across different ethnic groups in NYC. By analyzing naming preferences over time and across various cultural communities, we can gain insights into the evolving identity of the city and its residents. The project will examine how popular names differ among ethnic groups, how these preferences have changed over the years, and what these trends reveal about cultural integration and identity in one of the world's most diverse cities.
## Outline:
This project will explore the patterns and trends in baby naming across different ethnic groups in New York City. It will examine how naming preferences have changed over time and how they differ among various cultural communities.
## Data Source:
The primary data source will be the "Most Popular Baby Names by Sex and Mother's Ethnic Group in New York City" dataset from data.world. This dataset provides a rich source of information on baby names, including the child's sex, ethnicity of the mother, and the year the name was given.

This dataset provides a comprehensive list of popular baby names in New York City, categorized by the child's sex and the mother's ethnic group. It includes information on the year the name was given, allowing for analysis of trends over time. The data will be used to create visualizations that highlight naming patterns across different ethnic groups, track the rise and fall of specific names' popularity, and identify unique naming trends within each community. By analyzing this data, we can explore how cultural heritage influences naming choices and how these choices may reflect broader societal changes in New York City.
